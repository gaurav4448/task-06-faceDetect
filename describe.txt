In this task we have used AWS cloudformation (Infrastructure as code) service to create instance, extra volume of 5GB and then have attached them both. 
In the "code.yml" file, the code is written in YAML format which is just like key and value pairs. we can also write it in JSON.

In python we are using os module to run the AWS CLI commands but before that we have to configure our AWS CLI using "aws configure" command.

In the python code, i have used cv module for live dataset collection and "haarcascade" for face detection. we have trained the model using "LBPHfaceRecognizer".
